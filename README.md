Shuriken was developed by [Shogun Lab](http://www.shogunlab.com/) as an open source [Cross-Site Scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) (XSS) command line utility to aid web security researchers who want to test a list of XSS payloads in a web application. It allows a tester to easily change payload lists, log results and take screenshots of successful payloads. 

It should only be used on valid targets who have consented to pentesting, **please ensure you have permission** before using this tool against a web application.

## Installation
Shuriken can be installed by downloading the zip file [here](https://github.com/shogunlab/shuriken/archive/master.zip) or by cloning the [Git](https://github.com/shogunlab/shuriken.git) repository:

`git clone https://github.com/shogunlab/shuriken.git`

## Features
- Easily specify where in a URL the payload should be injected with the "{xss}" string.
- Quickly change payload lists.
- Take screenshots of successful XSS payloads.
- Save logs of reflected XSS payloads.
- Use fuzzy detection to log partial XSS reflections.

## Usage
To get a list of options and switches, enter:

`python shuriken_xss.py -h`

To test a list of payloads against a target URL, specify where the payloads will go with "{xss}" and enter:

`python shuriken_xss.py -u "http://example.com/target.php?name={xss}" -p "xss-payload-list.txt"`

### Taking screenshots

If you would like to screenshot and save all reflected XSS payloads, use the *-s* or *--screen* flag with a name for the screenshot images and enter:

`python shuriken_xss.py -s ExampleTarget -u "http://example.com/target.php?name={xss}" -p "xss-payload-list.txt"`

To wait a specific amount of time in between requests, use the *-t* flag with the amount of time to wait in seconds and enter:

`python shuriken_xss.py -t 1.5 -u "http://example.com/target.php?name={xss}" -p "xss-payload-list.txt"`

### Fuzzy XSS payload detection

To enable partial or fuzzy detection of XSS payloads in HTML source code, use the *-f* or *--fuzzy* flag with the level of detection you want to log. For example, the following command will only log XSS payload reflections that have a 75% matching score or above in the HTML source code returned:

`python shuriken_xss.py -f 75 -u "http://example.com/target.php?name={xss}" -p "xss-payload-list.txt"`

The default matching score supplied is 50% and will be applied when a flag with no number is given (e.g. -f or --fuzzy): 

`python shuriken_xss.py -f -u "http://example.com/target.php?name={xss}" -p "xss-payload-list.txt"`

Partial detection is applied through the use of SeatGeek's [FuzzyWuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) Python library `token_set_ratio()` method and additional information regarding this library can be found [here](http://chairnerd.seatgeek.com/fuzzywuzzy-fuzzy-string-matching-in-python/). 

Partial XSS reflections will be logged in a separate text file ending with "_partials.txt".

### Misc. usage and performance notes

**You must specify a payload and URL**, if you don't then you'll get an error. For an example payload to test with, check out this list of [common XSS payloads](https://github.com/foospidy/payloads/blob/master/owasp/fuzzing_code_database/xss/common.txt).

You also must have PhantomJS installed and configured in order for the tool to run in its default mode. See the next section for more details on this.

**There may be a noticeable slowdown of the tool when it is being used in a virtual machine such as VirtualBox.** For best performance, use Shuriken on a native machine. I am currently looking to address this virtual machine slowdown in a future update.

## Third party libraries and dependencies
This tool depends on the proper configuration and installation of the following:
- [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Python 2 is needed to run the tool.
- [Splinter](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) - Python library allowing use of a headless web browser for testing.
- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) - Headless WebKit browser used by Splinter for testing.
- [Selenium 2.0](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp) - WebDriver required by PhantomJS browser.
- [FuzzyWuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) - Partial XSS logging using fuzzy detection methods.
- [python-Levenshtein](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein/0.12.0) - Python extension for computing string edit distances and similarities. Allows faster fuzzy detection from the FuzzyWuzzy library.

Python dependencies can be installed using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Use your platform-specific mechanism to install PhatomJS (e.g. `brew` on OSX, `apt-get` on Debian or Ubuntu, etc). 

If you would prefer that this tool ***use a different browser for testing***, you can read the [Splinter docs](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#drivers) and insert your preferred browser in the "inject_payload" method where it says `browser = Browser("phantomjs")`. Leaving it blank as `browser = Browser()` will default to Firefox.
